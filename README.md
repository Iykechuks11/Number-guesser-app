#A simple number guesser application

The game generates a random number, and users are expected to make input a guess into the form provided for a limited trial of 3.

Once the trial attempts is exhausted, the user clicks the play again button to start playing all over again.

I completed this project using the JavaScript language, HTML5, and skeleton css (A dead simple, responsive boilerplate).
